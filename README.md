This is a level editor, written in Java b/c A) I already know the language and B) makes it more portable between Macs & PCs

Meant to be quick & intuitive, planning to drag & drop assets into a level
* "Assets" meaning environment details (rocks, trees, etc.) as well as objects (rope, bridges, NCPs, etc.)

Also will set event triggers eventually, but just focused on drag & drop + GUI basics for now

This was built on Windows 10 64-bit with AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.9.1+1 w/ HotSpot JVM: https://adoptopenjdk.net/
Please install either this or the AdoptOpenJDK 11 JRE to build & run the level editor from source.
May consider using packr https://github.com/libgdx/packr
