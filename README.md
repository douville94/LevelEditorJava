This is a level editor, written in Java b/c A) I already know the language and B) makes it more portable between Macs & PCs

Meant to be quick & intuitive, planning to drag & drop assets into a level
* "Assets" meaning environment details (rocks, trees, etc.) as well as objects (rope, bridges, NCPs, etc.)

Also will set event triggers eventually, but just focused on drag & drop + GUI basics for now
